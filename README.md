# Rspecdoodle

A doodle doodling a bit of Rspec, oddly a boodle of code for something crudely exuded.

This repo is the result of following this tutorial on Rspec: [Getting Started with Rspec](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-rspec)

Ruby code in the file `lib/rspecdoodle`.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rspecdoodle'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rspecdoodle

## Usage

Follow my train of thought from central station all the way to the island of Sodor.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
